TeX 9                                   

    Author:  Elias Toivanen 
    License: GPL 
    Version: 1.1.6

    TeX 9 is a ftplugin that enhances significantly the writing experience of
    high quality documents with LaTeX and Vim. The scope of TeX 9 is to rely
    first and foremost on features that are already available in Vim and try
    to keep things as simple and snappy as possible. 
    
    Most of TeX 9 is implemented in Python (2.6, 2.7) and therefore a Vim
    installation with Python support is required.  In addition, TeX 9 depends
    on the matchit plugin (>= 1.13.2) by Benji Fisher. Matchit is shipped with
    the standard installation of Vim but it is also bundled with TeX 9 for
    convenience. 

    TeX 9's main features are
        * Compile, debug and view documents from within Vim
        * Insert LaTeX code snippets with ease
        * Select-objects for inline maths and maths environments
        * Omni-completion of BibTeX database entries and label references
        * Filetype specific indentation (courtesy of Johannes Tanzler)
        * LaTeX2e manual (ported to Vim by Mikolaj Machowski)
        * No-hassle settings, relatively few mappings

    Shoutouts
        * Carl Mueller, this ftplugin was inspired by his `auctex.vim' script
        * Vim-LaTeX people Srinath Avadhanula, Mikolaj Machowski and Benji Fisher
        * Johannes Tanzler, Jose Aliste, Sergio Losilla
