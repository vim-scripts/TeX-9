1.1:
* SyncTeX support when using Evince (2.32)

- Doesn't support whitespaces or non-ASCII characters in filenames

* Jump to a BibTeX database (gb) from the manuscript.

- Looks at the <cword> variable under the cursor

* Improved BibTeX handling: 
- Databases in the compilation directory take precedence.

* Omni-completion () of fonts and pictures.

- font completion works with fontspec command \setmainfont
- picture completion works inside \includegraphics command
- supported formats: png, jpg, eps and pdf

1.1.5:
* Fixed bugs related to omni-completion of fonts/pics

1.1.6:
* The value of `makeprg' no longer interferes with other languages.
* The autocommands QuickFixCmdPre and QuickFixCmdPost are now
local to the LaTeX buffer for the same reason as above.
* Snippets now work when you have a BibTeX and a LaTeX file simultaneously on the buffer
list.
* Code clean-up.
* Improved error matching when an BibTeX entry is not found.
* Made TeX 9 work in a terminal.
* SyncTeX support dropped temporarily.

1.2
* The value of `maplocalleader' is not changed if defined already by the user.
* Move the main Python module to a separate file.
* SyncTeX support (Evince 3.4, latest SyncTeX).
* Robust environment operator: no need for syntax or matchit.
* TODO: inline maths operator.
* Omnicompletion of maths.
* Check included files for label completions.
* Deprecate automatic delimiter completion: it should be a separate plugin.
* TODO: make as g:tex_flavor.
* Lazy-load BibTeX completions: speeds up startup
* Handle complex LaTeX projects with multiple files gracefully: compilation,
    viewer launching, SyncTeXing.

1.2.1
* Methods that work in multi-file projects are now implemented with Python
decorators

* Improved <LocalLeader>R and <LocalLeader>C: append closing brace "}".
* New function tex_nine#Forward_search()
* NO_MODELINE message: consider also the case of empty file.
* Improved citation completion: consider only current line up to cursor
position
* <LocalLeader>½ inserts \sqrt{}

-  pass vim.current.buffer instead of vim.current.buffer.name
-  use pyeval() when needed
-  lazy load data whenever possible
-  renamed autoload functions and removed ! from function statements
* Significantly more robust handling of multi-file project
* Remove compiler file -- introduce tex_nine#SetCompiler()
* Make is allowed to be a makeprg
* Bugfix: indentation in sections whose caption contain the word `document'
* Bugfix: buggy setting `notimeout' removed
